MBTA TRANSIT LOCATOR

This app uses a user's location to determine the closest T-stop, using JavaScript's navigator.geolocation object.

Upon clicking on the stations, the name is displayed along with trains passing through the station and their direction and the time remaining until their arrival.


The app relies on the GOoogle Maps API and real-time data from the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority.
